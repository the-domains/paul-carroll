Making dinner can get frustrating or downright impossible
when one has to do so with "MINE MINE" or "I WANT MOMMY" ringing in your ears.
If you have reservations about how much time it's going to take to make a
particular recipe, chances are it will take even longer if the kids' and your
attention span are diverted by having to remove a DVD from the microwave.

I use these go to recipes when I want to make dinner on
auto-pilot to ensure I can keep an eagle ey on the children and be done in a
flash.

**South of the Border
Mac and Cheese**

INGREDIENTS

1

Box of Annie's Mac and Cheese (**DO NOT** used Store Brand or Kraft Mac
and Cheese. I'm all but positive we're going to find out the fake orange Kraft
Cheese is used in nuclear weapons.)

2

1 pound of 90% or more lean ground beef or 100%
lean ground turkey

3

1 16oz jar of Salsa

DIRECTIONS

Brown meat until no pink remains, then drain. Set aside and
make the mac and cheese according to the instructions. Combine meat, mac and
cheese, and the salsa in a large pot and simmer until warm.
